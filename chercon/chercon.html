                Black Conceptualism
            </h1>

            <h2>
                5 speculations towards
                the history of arts
            </h2>

            <p>
                After the archive group accidentally discovers the fragmentary archive of
                obscure local late-soviet underground art circle dubbed "black conceptualists", they attempt to reconstruct
                some narratives from local cultural history as affected by
                a demonic entity, whose activity was first acknowledged and described by "black conceptualists" - the Tomsk Worm.
            </p>
            <p>
                The project is drifting between various degrees of credibility of presented narratives and
                documents. Exposition encompasses units ranging from reenactment and homage to pieces from previosly non-existing archive,
                to actual documents, to sincere trickstery of self-appointed space enterpreneurs and paranormal researchers.
                The agency of the Tomsk Worm is revealed, among else, as corruptive to shared memories, recorded history and common epistemology
                thus making it possible for divergent timelines to coexist and cross-feed.
            </p>
            <p>
                5 throbbing plastic tubers on Worm's tails pulsate synchronously at 5 temporally disjointed fragments of the exposition. Those are occupied by First People's Arts Academy (1919); the Black Hundreds pogrom of 1905; paranormal history of Tomsk and it's focal point, SibNITSAYA (1990); the Sect of Phoenix (2000); and Siberian Space Society (present).

                The newspaper cut-outs, tracing the short lifecycle of First People's Arts Academy, that existed for several mounths of 1919 in Tomsk.
                The Academy was an ambitious project by painter and political activist Kazimir Zelenevsky. At time of civil war and hunger, Zelenevsky
                aimed to create an educational institution of a new type, that would be central to Siberian revolutionary artistic education and practice.
                The project was closed mainly due to counter-revolutionary uprising, thus becoming a part of fantastically ambitious historical might-have-been.
                Pasted fragments are taken from heated political debates on political role of art, that were ignited in press by this un-realised possibility.

                Trans-temporal collage depicts firefighters from the relative future, battling the fire on a 
                "Black Hundred's pogrom of 1905 in Tomsk" by Vladimir Vuchichevich-Sibirskii. This piece depicts a tragic
                event in Tomsk history, where spontaneous monarchist rally ended up in arson and brutal mass murder of railroad workers and revolution supporters. Accounts of these events are contradictory, with some of them making one wonder if mass insanity was in play, and tend to become more and more fictionalized in the following decades. According to Black Сonceptualists, such inconsistencies reveal that the agency of The Tomsk Worm is present.

                The Siberian Research Center for the Study of Anomalous Phenomena in the Environment (SibNITSAYA) is an organization for the study of anomalous phenomena, established in 1990 on the basis of the laboratory of natural and man-made electromagnetic systems of the Tomsk Polytechnic Institute.
                The SibNITSAYA team worked on the creation of equipment that generates and registers previously unknown combinations of physical fields, non-traditional technologies of interaction between humans, technosphere and the environment. Recommendations on the prevention of accidents, disasters and natural calamities were developed.
                Archive group prototyped an archive page, tracing the timeline of local paranormal occurencies and events. Copies of several documents are printed, to be then recycled as seed-bombs.

                The worm occupies a special place in the iconography of the sect. Little indistinguishable person is the worm, the cosmic provinciality of the little visionless person is the hell in which s/he lives and dies, a space corroded with worms, perforated, including multiple sections of nothing. And the worm is as if nothing itself had taken shape (or, better said, limited itself, having acquired it). On the longest night of 2000, the Sect of Phoenix welcomed the "beast of exhaustion" in Tomsk, posting flyers with indecipherable content on the streets. It was supposed that this beast would emerge into the light and devour the sun. Many believe that it was supposed to be a wolf, as one of the Sect's messages stated ("Children beg to release the wolf... children beg to release the beast... make straight his paths!"), but there is every reason to believe that it was worm, black like the sky over the west alley.
